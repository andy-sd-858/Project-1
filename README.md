# Project-1
Pet Page is a website where you can find your next pet.

A web page for pet lovers looking to adopt.
Find local adoptable pets and you can see exactly where they are located on a map
As a pet lover I would want to adopt a pet of my choice, I also want to know where the pet will be exactly located within a 30 mile radius, then I would want to know more details about the pet if available.
The user will be able to put in a zip code and search by pet type, age, breed, and gender.


Technologies used: JavaScript (PetFinder API, Mapbox API), HTML, CSS

Breakdown of tasks and roles: As teammates we tried to work together throughout a lot of the process, writing and reviewing a lot of code together while also having time to work on separate parts individually. Faris and Miguel worked with the HTML and CSS while Andy worked on getting the APIS and JavaScript functioning.

Challenges: Time was probably the most demanding challenge, with more time all aspects of the website could be improved. JavaScript and the APIâ€™s were probably the most difficult to work on for the page.

Successes: Overall getting the website to do what is intended is a big success, getting the pictures of the animals and the map to load was one of the best successes.


Directions for Future Development:

Get api to work cleaner with the current pets
Clean up CSS and overall have a more engaging website to look at
Add a save pet function to save your favorites
Add more pets to the website such as fish, hamsters, reptiles, and more.
Be able to go through multiple pages of pets.
Be able to get directions.
